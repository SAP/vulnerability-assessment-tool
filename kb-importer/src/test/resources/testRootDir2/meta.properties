description:  Arbitrary remote code execution with InvokerTransformer. With InvokerTransformer serializable collections can be build that execute arbitrary Java code. sun.reflect.annotation.AnnotationInvocationHandler#readObject invokes #entrySet and #get on a deserialized collection. If you have an endpoint that accepts serialized Java objects (JMX, RMI, remote EJB, ...) you can combine the two to create arbitrary remote code execution vulnerability. Fixed in versions 3.2.2, 4.1
